Immortalis
==========

Welcome to Immortalis, Aeria's greatest mobile success. 

Immortalis is a multiplayer mobile card game originally developed by a Japanese game company called “Pokelabo”. It is currently deployed in 4 territories.

# TODO / Work in progress about this repository

This repo will be organized in a similar fashion to the BAM repository (https://gitlab.aeriagames.com/bam/bam-server). We will separate all assets originally on app/www/img and add them to a separate repo called imm-assets. This way deployment will only update game files and all the assets will be already stored on AWS automatically.

In order to accomplish this we need to:
- Create jenkins jobs that support these operations
- Have our server architecture migrated to AWS (outsourced)
- Create all repos in a similar fashion to BAM
